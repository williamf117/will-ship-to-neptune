Move up with the W key, down with the S key, left with the A key and right with the D key.
You can rotate your character and aim your pistol by moving the mouse. You can shoot with left mouse.
You can use health stations to refill your health.
You can use energy stations to refill your pistol's energy.
Your pistol can break things such as big or small boxes.
There is an enemy up ahead. You can stay out of his sight by studying his patrol.
You can also shoot him until he dies. You should only use this as a last resort. You may get lucky and his pistol may have ammo in it too!
Enemies can't see very far, and large objects obstruct their view. Small boxes and Tables do not obstruct their view.
Make sure to stay hidden if you don't want to fight or are low on resources! You can hide behind the larger boxes.
These are lockers. These hold consumables that you can use!
You can try the tripwire by going to the right and placing it in the enemy's patrolling pathway. 
Hold down right mouse to prepare the Tripwire, then release right mouse to place and set it.
Vents are used in order to navigate to other areas. You can enter a vent by pressing the E key. Be careful, you might not always see where you end up!
Vents work both ways. You can go back if you want, but there isn't anything over there worth going back for.
Now that you've acquired multiple consumables, you have access to the Toolbelt. 
You can switch between them using the scroll wheel or you can use the number keys 1, 2, and 3 to select your equipment.
Inside these lockers are Stasis Grenades. You can use these to freeze enemies to sneak by them. Aim with the mouse then right click to throw the Stasis Grenade.
You can try out the stasis grenade by throwing it at the enemies here.
Explosive canisters can be shot at to explode. They do a LOT of damage. Try it out here, and make sure to stand back!
You can also use explosive canisters to blow open walls. Be careful though, as there may be consequences for blowing up exterior walls!
Explosive canisters can break objects your pistol can, too.
This device is called the Decoy Device. You can use this to make enemies go to a specific position. 
Hold down right mouse like the tripwire to see the radius, then release it to activate the Device.
Going up from here will get you out of this room through a vent, but an enemy is in the way. Head to the right to test the Decoy Device if you want to.
You can place the device around this area. Make sure that the enemy is in range!
Good work. You're almost out of the woods. Now it's the final test with a new enemy.
Berserkers are enemies that attack with swords instead of pistols. They are much deadlier than normal enemies. Good luck!s
Congratulations, you've finished the tutorial.
